        <div>What is Git?
        Git is a popular version control system. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, and has been maintained by Junio Hamano since then.
        
        It is used for:
        
        Tracking code changes
        Tracking who made changes
        Coding collaboration
        What does Git do?
        Manage projects with Repositories
        Clone a project to work on a local copy
        Control and track changes with Staging and Committing
        Branch and Merge to allow for work on different parts and versions of a project
        Pull the latest version of the project to a local copy
        Push local updates to the main project
        Working with Git
        Initialize Git on a folder, making it a Repository
        Git now creates a hidden folder to keep track of changes in that folder
        When a file is changed, added or deleted, it is considered modified
        You select the modified files you want to Stage
        The Staged files are Committed, which prompts Git to store a permanent snapshot of the files
        Git allows you to see the full history of every commit.
        You can revert back to any previous commit.
        Git does not store a separate copy of every file in every commit, but keeps track of changes made in each commit!
        Change Platform:
        Shift focus to GitHubGitHub
        Shift focus to BitbucketBitbucket
        Shift focus to GitLabGitLab
        Why Git?
        Over 70% of developers use Git!
        Developers can work together from anywhere in the world.
        Developers can see the full history of the project.
        Developers can revert to earlier versions of a project.
        What is GitHub?
        Git is not the same as GitHub.
        GitHub makes tools that use Git.
        GitHub is the largest host of source code in the world, and has been owned by Microsoft since 2018.
        In this tutorial, we will focus on using Git with GitHub.
